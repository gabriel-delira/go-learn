In this folder we can test 2 different things:

1 - Executing "go test" go executes our HelloTest and return if the test passed or failed (in this case the string in both files must be equals to success)
2 - Executing "go mod init some/Path/here"(path exmaple = example.com/username/repo) we create our module (a .mod file will appear inside the folder)
